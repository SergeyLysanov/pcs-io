/* Rearrange elements of data array of size N so that all items with indexes < k are less than data[k] while
 * all items with indexes > k are greater or equal to data[k]. So this means that on output data[k] is also the
 * k-th element of the data array in the sorted order. The routine uses the caller-provided comparison and swap
 * functions. Both takes element index as the arguments. The comparison function must return an integer less than,
 * equal to, or greater than zero if the first argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or
 * greater than the second. The callbacks may operate on the data array directly or deal with index so the
 * original data will be intact.
