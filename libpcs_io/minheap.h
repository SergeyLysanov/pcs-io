  This file implement a min-heap.

  A quick recap (see https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq/ for more detail):

  Min-heap is a perfectly balanced binary tree of items that have weights (or priorities)
  associated to them. This tree satisfies the "min-heap property": the weight of a node
  is less than or equal to weights of the children of it. Perfect balancing means that
  all leaf nodes are located at the same depth.

  Min-heap supports the following operations with complexity logarithmic in the size of a heap:
  * insert an item,
  * remove an item of the minimal weight,
  * associate a new weight to an item.

  A classical implementation of a min-heap uses an array of pointers to items of a heap,
  where indices of children of an item k are 2*k+1 and 2*k+2.

  This implementation does not allocate additional memory. Instead, it requires users
  to embed struct mh_node into items that are added to a heap. It also allows to remove
  any item, not just the minimal-weight one (also in logarithmic time).
